# 📍 Contoso Pizza – Toronto, Canada 🇨🇦

**Description:**
In the heart of the Distillery District, Contoso Pizza Toronto occupies a beautifully restored Victorian-era warehouse. Exposed beams, industrial lighting, and warm wood tones create an inviting atmosphere. We celebrate Canada's multicultural spirit with creative toppings like peameal bacon, Quebec cheese curds, and maple-glazed vegetables. Don't miss the "Poutine Pizza" or "Smoked Salmon & Dill." Pair with Ontario craft beers, Canadian wines, or our signature maple lemonade.
